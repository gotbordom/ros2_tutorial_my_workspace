This was a publisher / subscriber written in cpp mostly pregenerated by ros2 tutorials and ros2 pkg create ....

This is also being updated to now make use of my custom interfaces created in /project_root/src/my_interface_package_cpp/

The changes here are to now use the srv for taking three ints instead of the original two, returning a single sum.
